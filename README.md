# Secure-Pipes
This repository comes with no warranties, no instructions, and no support. I merely posted the code 
because I don't have any time to work on this project anymore. I hope someone can find the time to update, improve, manage, etc. 

This was my first macOS coding project, so please excuse "everything." I never claimed to be the world's best or even a good programmer. 

Note this last compliled successfully under macOS Big Sur.
